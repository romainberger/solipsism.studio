  <h1>Checklist</h1>

  <h2>Guitar recording</h2>

  <ul class="basic-list">
    <li>change your strings</li>
    <li>pick hard and if possible use thick strings</li>
    <li>make sure your guitar is correctly intonated and tuned</li>
    <li>if you have active pickups, use new batteries</li>
    <li>keep only the best records, re-record a thousand times if needed until it sounds perfect</li>
    <li>record DI with no processing. no pedals, no effects</li>
    <li>at least 2 guitar tracks for each part</li>
    <li>since you will record multiple parts for all guitars, it can be a good option to nominate one rythm guitar player that will record everything. This is for the purpose of consistency and clarity</li>
    <li>make sure to play aggressively and really dig in to the strings. The energy in the attack will dramastically impact the final sound, no matter how it is reamped after. Make sure not to attack too hard as it may tend to put the strings out of tune. With practice and the correct string gauge the perfect spot can be found.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Bass recording</h2>

  <ul class="basic-list">
    <li>Buy new strings and stretch them out for a few minutes by hand before you begin tracking</li>
    <li>pick/attack hard</li>
    <li>make sure your bass is correctly intonated and tuned</li>
    <li>if you have active pickups, use new batteries</li>
    <li>keep only the best records, re-record a thousand times if needed until it sounds perfect</li>
    <li>record DI with no processing. no pedals, no effects</li>
    <li>if you have a guitar pro file or a midi file of your bass programmed, please send it as well. It is also possible to work with only programmed bass</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Vocals</h2>

  <ul class="basic-list">
    <li>use a pop shield</li>
    <li>record multiple times all parts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>General</h2>

  <ul class="basic-list">
    <li>make sure all tracks you provide are consistently and clearly named across all your songs.</li>
    <li>export all your tracks starting at the same time. They should all line up at the same starting position.</li>
    <li>give a midi or text file with all tempo changes with precise tempos and time. Make sure to notate what bars all the tempo changes occur and if applicable, what time signature each section is in.</li>
    <li>make sure your tracks don't clip.</li>
    <li>export a master with all tracks.</li>
    <li>check your files before sending them. Re-import all your tracks, make sure they all line up correctly and that nothing is wrong.</li>
  </ul>

  <br>
  <p>Editing is not mixing. If your tracks needs editing, do it before sending them for mix, or precise that you want editing. It will be charged accordingly.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>All the preparation instructions are here to make sure the mixing will be done in the best conditions possible and will be able to provide the best work at the end. Because the truly important part is your music and how it will sound.</p>
